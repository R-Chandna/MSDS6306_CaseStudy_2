```{r}
# In order to import XLSX, we install the package "readxl" into our environment.  After loading library "readxl" we're able to use read_excel function to import the sheet "HR-employee-attrition Data" into a dataframe.  
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
cs2DF <- read_excel("CaseStudy2-data_clean.xlsx", "HR-employee-attrition Data")

# 2A - There are 1470 rows (observations) and 35 columns (variables)
dimDF <- dim(cs2DF)
names(dimDF) <- c("Rows", "Columns")
dimDF

# 2B - Results of column names and its string length count.  
## Need to find a more elegant function to filter the list and subset only values greater than 12.  For now, this will suffice.
lettercount <- str_length(names(cs2DF))
countDF <- data.frame(cbind(names(cs2DF), lettercount))
names(countDF) <- c("Variable", "LetterCount")
countDF

# 2C - Due to Qualtrics, the following columns will have its integer value replaced by the definitions provided in the "Data Definitions" sheet.  
## Will need to seperate the interger and characters into two seperate columns.
datadefDF <- read_excel ("CaseStudy2-data_clean.xlsx", "Data Definitions")
datadefDF

# 2D - Converting columns to correct data types.
## Will work on over weekend.
